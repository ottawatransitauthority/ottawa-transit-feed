This codebase is used to create the Ottawa Transit Feed
http://ottawatransitauthority.ca/feed

What does it do?

  • It imports the official OC Transpo feed into an SQLite database. 
  • It applies a slew of corrections to the data.
  • It exports an authoritative dataset as a General Transit Data Feed.

How do I do it?

  Step 1. 
  Run `rake` to setup the log, db and transit_feed folders, create the database and run the test suite.

  Step 2.
  `rake download` to get the latest OC Transpo data feed. It will be saved in the transit_feeds folder.
  
  Step 2. 
  `rake import` to import the official data. This will take a LONG time.
  
  Step 3. 
  `rake export` to export the authoritative dataset. The exported feed will be saved in the transit_feeds folder.
