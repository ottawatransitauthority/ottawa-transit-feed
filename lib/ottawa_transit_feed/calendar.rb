    # Calendar records contain a service_id that uniquely identifies a set of dates when transit 
    # service is available for one or more routes. 
    #
    # The service_id value is dataset unique. It is referenced by trips and calendar dates.
    # 
    # The calendar dataset provided in the OC Transpo feed is usually accurate and complete. 
    # Ottawa Trasnsit Feed doesnâ€™t apply any changes to this dataset.
