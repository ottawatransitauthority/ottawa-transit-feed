    # Trips travel along a route. Thay make several stops along the way picking up passengers and dropping
    # them off. Operators are expected to drive the trip according to itâ€™s scheduled stop times.
    #
    # Trips are primarily a scheduling association that provide these core attributes:
    #
    #   trip.calendar => A schedule that defines the period of time when the trip is operated.
    #   trip.headsign => A headsign that can be matched to the signage on a service vehicle.
    #   trip.route    => Provides the route number and name of the trip.
    #   trip.moments  => Ordered list moments in the trip. Each moment provides an arrival and departure time and a stop id.
    #   trip.stops    => Ordered list of stop locations in the trip.
